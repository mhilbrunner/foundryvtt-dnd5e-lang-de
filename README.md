## Contributing & adding translations

Contributions are always welcome! Below are some ways to contribute and how to get started.

### Adding new translation strings

To add new translations:

0. Fork this repo and check it out locally
1. Copy the up to date english language file into languages/en.json
(from [here](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/raw/master/lang/en.json))
2. Run compare.py
3. languages/diff.txt should now contain keys which need to be translated
4. After translating, run merge.py
5. de.json should now contain updated translations
6. Commit, push and submit a Pull Request!

### Adding new compendium translations

This is a bit more involved, as compendia are currently translated using the
awesome [Babele](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/babele) module.
The [Babele repository](https://gitlab.com/riccisi/foundryvtt-babele) has a
brief tutorial.

Compendium translations are located in `compendium/`.

In cases where there is only a small set of values for a field (like *Alignments*),
those are translated using Babele converter functions in `src/`:
<https://github.com/mhilbrunner/foundryvtt-dnd5e-lang-de/blob/compendia/src/converters.js>

Those are also useful for translation values that are used in multiple places,
like *Item Rarities*.
